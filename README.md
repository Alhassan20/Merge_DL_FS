# Merge_DL_FS
In this code, we develop a robust model for image classification with a DL-based model as a feature extraction backbone, which is achieved using MobileNetV3 architecture. In addition, a novel feature selection (FS) algorithm is introduced to ignore the unimportant features extracted using MobileNetV3.
